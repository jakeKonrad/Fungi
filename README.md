# Different flavours of functional and dependently typed graphs.

#### Roadmap

The vague plan is to explore properties functional graphs. The two types I am interesting in is the [initial algebra](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/2423982_An_Initial-Algebra_Approach_to_Directed_Acyclic_Graphs) approach by Jeremy Gibbons and the [inductive](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~erwig/fgl/haskell/) approach by Martin Erwig. I also want to explore adding optional edge information to the graphs as defined by Gibbons (see [here](https://github.com/jakeKonrad/Fungi/blob/main/Fungi/Flow.idr) for the current try). I also want to explore functions between to two representations.
